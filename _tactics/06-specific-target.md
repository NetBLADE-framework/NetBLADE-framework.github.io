parent: /phases/02-reconnaissance
ref-id: TAC-06
short-desc: Specific Target Reconnaissance is performed on a specific single target, such as a product, organisation, or individual. This is similar to "Loose Target", but the key differentiator is that here the adversary knows and has specified exactly what they are looking for.
