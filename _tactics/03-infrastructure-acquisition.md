short-desc: Before compromising a victim, adversaries may buy, lease, or rent infrastructure that can be used during targeting. A wide variety of infrastructure exists for hosting and orchestrating operations. Infrastructure solutions include physical or cloud servers, proxies, domains, and third-party web services. Additionally, botnets are available for theft, rent or purchase (other adversaries may build their own botnets).
