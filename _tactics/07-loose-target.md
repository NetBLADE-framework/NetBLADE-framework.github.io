title: Loose Target
parent: /phases/02-reconnaissance
ref-id: TAC-07
short-desc: Loose Target Reconnaissance is performed to identify potential targets from a website, catalogue, or similar. This is similar to "Specific Target", but the key differentiator is that here the adversary has not specified any individual target, and is instead trying to identify a target of opportunity and so is scanning more broadly.
