<p>In the Post-Attack phase, the adversary will take steps to ensure that a product or service is provided to them and handed into their possession. The adversary will often monetise their attack, such as by selling the acquired objective on an online marketplace or forum. Activities in this stage are sometimes performed by a bot and sometimes require manual intervention by the adversary.</p>
