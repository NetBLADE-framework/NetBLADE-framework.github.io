<p>Items are added to a basket and held there until the adversary completes the checkout process; the adversary will only do so after confirming a resale of the item(s) in the cart or the cart itself, at an acceptable profit margin. Alternatively, they will hold the items for a sustained period to prevent real customers from purchasing the item from this store.</p>
