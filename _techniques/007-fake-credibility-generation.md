title: Fake Credibility Generation
parent: [/tactics/02-credential-acquisition, /tactics/09-human-emulation]
ref-id: TEQ-007
short-desc: The adversary seeks to establish their credibility by building a false reputation. Some sites may limit certain interactions or activities to those accounts that have performed certain actions or been active on the site for a certain length of time. Other defensive measures include a broad assessment of Internet activity for human verification, but adversaries may have automated tools mimic human Internet activity, building up a fake profile with sufficient credibility to interact with the target site as desired.
