<p>Comment Flooding is when an adversary repeatedly posts the same or similar comments over and over. This may be employed to prevent the comments page from being used in its intended fashion by overwhelming legitimate users with large numbers of comments, or to hide comments of a particular type by pushing them down the page or onto subsequent pages.</p>
