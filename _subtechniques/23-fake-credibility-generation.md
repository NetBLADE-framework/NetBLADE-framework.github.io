<p>The adversary seeks to establish their credibility by building a false reputation. Some sites may limit certain interactions or activities to those accounts that have performed certain actions or been active on the site for a certain length of time. Alternatively, where defensive measures look at the manner in which the user has interacted with the Internet more broadly to determine if they are human or a bot, an adversary may employ a bot that interacts with the Internet more broadly in order to build up a fake profile that has sufficient credibility to interact with the target site in the desired manner.</p>
