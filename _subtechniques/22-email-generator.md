<p>An email generator is a temporary electronic mailbox that provides an adversary the ability to send and receive messages. This allows the adversary to conceal their true identity and contact details, impersonate others, bypass blocks placed on specific emails, and to bypass restrictions based around limiting activities on a site by email address.</p>
