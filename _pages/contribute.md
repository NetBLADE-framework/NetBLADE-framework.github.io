<h2>History</h2>
<p>The framework was initially created by the Threat Research Team at Netacea. This team consisted of Matthew Gracey-McMinn, Antony Barnett, and Liam Jones. Netacea is a specialist in handling Business Logic Attacks and providing Bot Management solutions. The Project initially began to aid Netacea in the detection and mitigation of business logic threats, but quickly evolved into an open-source project sponsored by Netacea. The team analysed the extensive data gathered by Netacea, and combined it with the results of focussed research into the stages of different Business Logic Attacks. These were then used to create the basis of a first draft of the BLADE Framework.</p>

<p>This first draft was then shared with a variety of individuals (several of whom later joined the Core Contributors team). These individuals provided feedback including new definitions, changes to existing definitions, and removal of unnecessary definitions. Once these changes had been implemented the framework was rolled out to further individuals and began to be employed in the detection and mitigation of Business Logic Attacks in a variety of business cases.
On June 16th, 2021, the BLADE Framework was formally released as an open source framework. Its goal being to provide all defenders with a tool by which to understand and improve their ability to detect and defend against Business Logic Attacks.</p>
