short-desc: Fake account creation bots abuse the signup process of a webservice to create user accounts in bulk, using stolen or fake identities. These bots automate multiple signup requests, which can be spread out over long periods of time or using IP addresses from different geolocations to hide the fact that they are controlled by one person. Many advanced fake account creation bots can also bypass email, phone, and CAPTCHA verifications.
