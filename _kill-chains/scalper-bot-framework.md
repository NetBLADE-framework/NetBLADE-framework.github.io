<p>Ahead of the actual attack, the adversary establishes resources to aid their operations against the primary targeted victim.</p>
<p>In Resource Development, an adversary will acquire resources (e.g., credentials, infrastructure, payment details as an example) that they will then be able to use in later stages against the primary target of the attack. This stage is ""pre-attack"" as it impacts third parties who are not the intended target - for instance an adversary may acquire or access a botnet which they then use to launch attacks against the primary victim.</p>
