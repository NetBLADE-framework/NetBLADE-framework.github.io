short-desc: Arbitrage betting, or as it is more commonly known “arb” betting, is a form of gambling where the gambler exploits the differences in bookmakers’ opinions on certain odds, thereby ensuring that whatever the outcome of the event the gambler will always turn a profit. Arbitrage betting bots automatically bet on all possible outcomes of the same event simultaneously, placing these bets with different bookmakers who disagree on odds, to guarantee that at least a small return will be made.
