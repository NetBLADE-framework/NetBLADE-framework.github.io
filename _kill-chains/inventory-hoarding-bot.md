short-desc: An inventory hoarding bot (also known as a spinner bot) is an automated tool that adds items to a basket and holds them there held until the bot operator decides to complete the checkout process. Some inventory hoarding bots will automatically relist the item on a third party reselling platform and only complete the checkout process once their relisting is sold.
