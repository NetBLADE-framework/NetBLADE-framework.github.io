short-desc: A credential stuffing bot is used to test previously leaked credentials (typically username and password pairs) to determine if they are valid on a target webservice or API. These bots validate credential pairs against their target webservice or API by automating login attempts, allowing adversaries to test and validate credentials at mass scale.
